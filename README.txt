This program executes a randomized response survey based on the Improved Warner's Randomized Response technique which was developed by myself and Dr.Singh, and presented in my thesis. Please see "Survey Example" in order to see screenshots of the program

Suppose we wished to conduct a survey in which we ask a sample of a population whether or not they possess sensitive characteristic "A". This can be anything, for example, "Have you used any illicit drugs in the past year?"

For obvious reasons a question such as this might lead to problems arising from the issue of privacy. We, the surveyors, know that we will keep the responses anonymous, but how can a surveyee be sure of this? They have no way to know that whatever response they give will not be stored in some form or fashion. Thus, we can use randomized response techniques in order to ENSURE the privacy of the surveyee's response.

My method improves on the Warner's Randomized Response Technique in that a surveyee is presented with a dialouge box, in private, with a sensitive characteristic question presented. In this case, "Have you ever used a JUUL before". The surveyee then clicks "Yes" or "No", and is then presented with a randomly generated number. The number is generated by computing the product of a negative binomial and binomial distribution, along with a randomly generated probability itself to be associated with those distributions.

Using the unbiased estimator presented in my thesis, we can then measure the responses of the sample in order to estimate the population proportion possessing the sensitive characteristic of interest.
